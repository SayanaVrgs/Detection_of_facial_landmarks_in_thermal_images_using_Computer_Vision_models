## Overview
Thermal imaging stands as a remarkable and compact technique for detecting, quantifying, and displaying heat patterns, especially in situations where visible light is scarce. In healthcare sector,  thermal imaging is used to study a broad number of diseases where skin temperature can reflect the presence of inflammation in underlying tissues or where blood flow is increased or decreased due to a clinical irregularity. It can also be used to identify and analyze biosignal markers thereby helping with non-intrusive monitoring of body vital stats. The issue is today's readily available computer vision models have mostly been trained on visible light images due to whuch it would be difficult to just their performance with thermal images. In this project, I compare the performance of four pretrained computer vision models to identify facial landmarks.

## Dataset used
The  thermal images used in this project were sourced from [Universit√© Laval Face Motion and Time-Lapse Video Database](http://www.qirt.org/liens/FMTV.htm)
